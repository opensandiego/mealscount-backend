    <h3>Is Meals Count free to use?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Meals Count is a free tool. You do not need an account, username, or
      password to access Meals Count.
    </p>

    <h3>Is Meals Count available only for California schools?</h3>
    <p>
      Meals Count is available <strong>for all states</strong>! School district
      data is pre-populated based upon the
      <a
        href="https://frac.org/research/resource-library/community-eligibility-cep-database"
        >FRAC CEP database</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why is the data displayed for my school district different than our actual
      data (e.g. enrollment, total eligible, average daily participation)?
    </h3>
    <p>The prepopulated California Meals Count data includes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enrollment data from the 2019-2020 school year;</li>
      <li>
        Estimated ISPs derived from direct certification for free school meals
        through CalFresh/SNAP and CalWORKs participation during July-November
        2019; and
      </li>
      <li>Average daily meal participation from April 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that the school list may include some charter schools and may
      exclude some preschools/early learning programs under your jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the best recommended grouping, we strongly encourage you to edit
      the school list and the data affiliated with each school to most
      accurately reflect current enrollment, eligibility, and meal
      participation.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the source of the data included for each school/district?</h3>
    <p>
      The data is pre-loaded from
      <a
        href="https://frac.org/research/resource-library/community-eligibility-cep-database"
        >FRAC CEP database</a
      >. You will need to update this data with your projected Average Daily
      Participation for Breakfast and Lunch, as well as updated anticipated
      total enrollment and identified students.
    </p>

    <h3>Are charter schools included in Meals Counts?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, charter schools that operate the National School Lunch Program and/or
      School Breakfast Program are included in Meals Count.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the reimbursement rates used in Meals Count?</h3>
    <p>
      The reimbursement rates are preset to 2019-20 federal reimbursement rates
      for the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the edit function to adjust the dollar amounts listed under
      “Federal Reimbursement Rates” as desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the rates don’t impact the grouping optimization feature,
      but we understand you need a calculation of estimated annual reimbursement
      in order to make informed decisions about your school meal programs.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Are state meal reimbursements included in the Estimated Annual
      Reimbursement?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, the Estimated Annual Reimbursement <strong>only</strong> includes
      federal reimbursement. The estimate does <strong>not</strong> include any
      meal reimbursement funded by the states. Please consider including the
      projected state-funded reimbursement when assessing the feasibility of
      adopting CEP among your schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: you can use the edit function to adjust the dollar amounts listed
      under “Federal Reimbursement Rates” as needed.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Are severe-need reimbursements included in the Estimated Annual
      Reimbursement?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, the Estimated Annual Reimbursement does
      <strong>not</strong> automatically include the severe-need reimbursement.
      You can use the edit function to adjust the dollar amounts listed under
      “Federal Reimbursement Rates” as appropriate for your district.
    </p>

    <h3>Once I have results from Meals Count, what’s next?</h3>
    <p>
      Meals Count is a tool that groups schools in an effort to optimize
      reimbursement through CEP. Our aim is to help schools make informed
      decisions about adopting CEP to nourish the learning, growth, and
      development of their students.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognize that many factors may impact your decision to implement CEP,
      including, but certainly not limited to participation rates, meal debt,
      revenue from a la carte sales, projected enrollment, and the prevalence of
      hunger and hardship amongst your students.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that you use the grouping results from Meals Count to help
      assess the financial, operational, and programmatic outcomes of
      implementing CEP. The
      <a
        href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/community-eligibility-provision"
        >United States Department of Agriculture</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="https://frac.org/community-eligibility"
        >Food Research and Action Center</a
      >
      have developed financial calculators and other resources to help with
      those assessments. School Nutrition Program County Specialists with the
      California Department of Education are also available to
      <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/nu/sn/cep.asp"
        >provide assistance with CEP</a
      >.
