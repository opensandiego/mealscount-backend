Optimizing a free-meal reimbursement program for K-12 schools

## How
Community Eligibility Provision (CEP)
CEP is a program of the USDA that allows schools to serve meals free to all students, without having to collect paper or online applications. Students are identified as eligible based on their participation in other means tested programs, like CalFresh and Medicaid. Schools are able to maximize their reimbursement because when meals are served universally free, it is easier to adopt service models that increase student participation, like “breakfast after the bell.” Plus schools are guaranteed a reimbursement structure that is stable for four years at a time.
